For this project, I compiled 2 CSV files to show to impact of drug regimen on mice to see if there were any correlations.

Analysis:

-There is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen, with a correlation coefficient of 0.84. The p-value suggests that this correlation is statistically significant. The linear regression analysis indicates a slope of 0.95, intercept of 21.55, and an R-squared value of 0.71. These values indicate a moderately strong relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.

-Overall, this data provides insights into the relationship between different variables in the study, such as drug regimen, mouse weight, and tumor volume. It allows for further analysis and exploration of the effectiveness of specific drug regimens in treating tumors and understanding the impact of variables on the observed outcomes.
